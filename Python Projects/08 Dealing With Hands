# Problem 2 - Dealing with Hands

# A hand is the set of letters held by a player during the game. The player is initially dealt a set of random 
# letters. For example, the player could start out with the following hand: a, q, l, m, u, i, l. In our program, a hand will 
# be represented as a dictionary: the keys are (lowercase) letters and the values are the number of times the particular 
# letter is repeated in that hand. For example, the above hand would be represented as:
# hand = {'a':1, 'q':1, 'l':2, 'm':1, 'u':1, 'i':1}    

# Implement the updateHand function. Make sure this function has no side effects: i.e., it must not mutate the hand 
# passed in. Before pasting your function definition here, be sure you've passed the appropriate tests in test_ps4a.py.

# Your implementation of updateHand should be short (ours is 4 lines of code). It does not need to call any helper functions.

# official code begins here:

def updateHand(hand, word):

    output = hand.copy()

    for letter in word:
        if letter in output.keys():
            output[letter] -= 1

    return output
