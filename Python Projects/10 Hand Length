# This program is from the MITx-6.00.1 Introduction to Computer Science & Programming using Python.
# It is Problem 4 of 7 in the Problem Set for Week 4: Good Programming Practices.

# Problem 4 - Hand Length

# We are now ready to begin writing the code that interacts with the player. We'll be implementing the 
# playHand function. This function allows the user to play out a single hand. First, though, you'll need to 
# implement the helper calculateHandlen function, which can be done in under five lines of code.

# official code begins here:

def calculateHandlen(hand):
    """ 
    Returns the length (number of letters) in the current hand.
    
    hand: dictionary (string int)
    returns: integer
    """
    sum = 0

    for value in hand.values():
        sum += value

    return sum
