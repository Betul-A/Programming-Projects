# This program is from the MITx-6.00.1 Introduction to Computer Science & Programming using Python
# It is Problem 3 of 4 in the Problem Set for Week 2: Structured Types . 

# Problem 3 - Printing Out All Available Letters

# Next, implement the function getAvailableLetters that takes in one parameter - a list of letters, lettersGuessed. This function
# returns a string that is comprised of lowercase English letters - all lowercase English letters that are not in lettersGuessed.

# Example Usage:
# >>> lettersGuessed = ['e', 'i', 'k', 'p', 'r', 's']
# >>> print(getAvailableLetters(lettersGuessed))
# abcdfghjlmnoqtuvwxyz

# Note that this function should return the letters in alphabetical order, as in the example above.
# For this function, you may assume that all the letters in lettersGuessed are lowercase.

# official code begins here:

def getAvailableLetters(lettersGuessed):
    '''
    lettersGuessed: list, what letters have been guessed so far
    returns: string, comprised of letters that represents what letters have not
      yet been guessed.
    '''
    string = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

    temp = ""essed:
            temp += i

    for i in string:
        if i not in lettersGu

    return temp
