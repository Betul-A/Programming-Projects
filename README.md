# Programming-Projects
This is an archive of all the programming projects I have accomplished over the years. 

There is a folder for each programming language I prodominantly use and wish to store in my portfolio.
In each folder lists what number project it is (ie the lower the number, the older it is).
Finally you will find the official name of the program as the last listed item of the file name. 

I hope you enjoy taking a peek at my portfolio!
