# Programming-Projects
This is an archive of all the programming projects I have accomplished over the years. 

The files are named accordingly with what language the code is written in.
Then it lists what number project it is (ie the lower the number, the older it is).
Finally you will find the official name of the program as the last listed item of the file name. 

I hope you enjoy taking a peek at my portfolio!
